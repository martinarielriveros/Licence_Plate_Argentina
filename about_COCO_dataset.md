The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
COCO contains 330K images, with 200K images having annotations for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks.
The dataset comprises 80 object categories, including common objects like cars, bicycles, and animals, as well as more specific categories such as umbrellas, handbags, and sports equipment.
Annotations include object bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and captions for each image.
COCO provides standardized evaluation metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection, and mean Average Recall (mAR) for segmentation tasks, making it suitable for comparing model performance.


<h1>Dataset Structure</h1>

The COCO dataset is split into three subsets:

Train2017: This subset contains 118K images for training object detection, segmentation, and captioning models.

Val2017: This subset has 5K images used for validation purposes during model training.

Test2017: This subset consists of 20K images used for testing and benchmarking the trained models. Ground truth annotations for this subset are not publicly available, and the results are submitted to the COCO evaluation server for performance evaluation.
